<h1>⟡Welcome to Divya's first machine learning project⟡</h1>
<p>This application was created using Streamlit. This application uses a 
    machine learning model to predict whether a child may develop 
    myopia within the next 5 years. This machine learning model was created using 
     logistic regression, and a data set from the 1990s from Kaggle. </p>
<h2>⟡Possible Sources of Bias⟡</h2>
     <p>This data set was collected in the 1990s and only involves children, so this could cause
        bias or errors in mispredicting myopia. The dataset is linked  <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mscgeorges/myopia-study?resource=download">here.
